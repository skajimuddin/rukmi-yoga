          This website has been taken down due to a breach of internship commitments by <strong>Sagar</strong>, the owner of <strong>Astu Creative</strong>, a company based in Pune, Maharashtra.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          As interns working remotely as full-stack developers since <strong>March 12, 2025</strong>, we were promised a certificate and a stipend upon completion of our first month. As of today, <strong>May 18, 2025</strong>, these have not been provided.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-800 mb-4">
          Multiple follow-ups through messages and calls have been ignored. The lack of communication and non-fulfillment of promises made has forced us to take this action to protect others from similar experiences.
        </p>

        <p className="text-red-700 font-semibold mb-4">
          We strongly advise caution to anyone planning to engage professionally with <strong>Sagar or Astu Creative</strong>.
